                Iâ€™ll take all the pains, for to me they are no stranger.
                Youâ€™ll be the queen in the kingdom of my heart;
                And then Iâ€™ll be the king, so weâ€™ll never be apart.
                Youâ€™ll be my majestyâ€” I will serve you forever;
                And for all of the times, I will leave you never</p>
